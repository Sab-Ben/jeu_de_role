# Jeu De Role App
Jeu de role's application that generates custom characters for a role-playing game. The
characters have basic characteristics and can be dynamically assigned special abilities.
They are stored in a persistent system, and certain game rules are accessible
globally.

# Technical constraints (mandatory):
Must use the following elements:
• The Builder design pattern to create characters.
• The Decorator design pattern to dynamically add special abilities.
• The Singleton design pattern for global game configuration.
• The DAO pattern to store and retrieve characters.
• Collections to manage character groups.
• Genericity to design a generic DAO.

## Technologies
